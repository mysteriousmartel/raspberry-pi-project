# Raspberry Pi Project (Working Title)

## Who Am I
<p align="center">Hi! I am a fairly new engineering student investigating optics and electromagnetism at Boston University. Until my start at BU, I spent seven years studying linguistics and translation, so transitioning to STEM was a huge change for me. There have been a lot of things to catch up on, things I've had to put on hold learning due to time and financial constraints, and other mental struggles that come with this new career path. Still, I love what I'm doing, and don't regret a day of this new experience.
