# ESL Google Assistant Controller (Seigyo)

## Who we are

### Background
Hi! I (Jenny) am a fairly new engineering student investigating optics and electromagnetism at Boston University. Until my start at BU, I spent seven years studying linguistics and translation, so transitioning to STEM was a huge change for me. There have been a lot of things to catch up on, things I've had to put on hold learning due to time and financial constraints, and other mental struggles that come with this new career path. Still, I love what I'm doing, and don't regret a day of this new experience.

One of the things that has been lacking from my program is the opportunity to learn programming. Spending all of your time catching up doing math and physics problems takes away time from building code that goes into data collection, experimentation, and other modern approaches to science. After spending last semester painfully pushing through two coding courses, I realized I needed a calmer environment where I could learn in my own way: picking up computer languages such that it serves my interests and career goals. My professor offered me the chance to do so over winter break through creating my own programming project, which brings me to this job now.

## The Project
Originally, I intended to build a simple rotating polarizer using a a Raspberry Pi, but given the time it takes for servo motors to ship over, I'm going to use what I have on hand.

<p align="center">The current supplies I have are:</p>

- Raspberry Pi (2, I think, not entirely sure)
- Google Nest Mini (Second Gen)
- My ASUS Laptop
- A bunch of computer mice
- My partner's keyboard (hoping to borrow one at school rather than buying an extra one that I probably won't need that often)
- Lots of Nintendo equipment (Switch, 3DS, etc.)
- Xbox 360
- Wireless headphones
- My Android phone
- Breadboards, resistors, LEDs, etc. for circuitry

I'm sure within this assortment of tools there is something cool I can make that will help me learn.

## Project Goal
My personal goal is to just become more confortable with programming. I feel like my classes threw me into simply providing answers without actually sitting down and understanding the thoughts behind the code. By the end of this, I just want to be able to actually explain what my project does from the inside out.
          
The goal of this actualy project is TBD, since I don't know what I'm making yet.

(Jan. 20 update) I am now focused on building an Android app that allows users to create new commands for Google Assistant. After playing with my Google Nest Mini, I learned that the device is very limited in the actions it can take. I am hoping to improve its understanding of commands through a smart controller that allows you to input verbal directions and route the command to opening a separate action.

## So, what is it?
This took a long time to figure out, but in the final moments, I realized what was most important to me was to make something that would be useful to someone in my life. That person ended up being my mom.

This controller is trained via Google Actions and Dialogflow to be taught "Broken English". My mom moved to the US in 1992, but still has maintained her native accent until now, which has made conversations difficult for her sometimes. This has also made it hard for her to engage with the modern world's smart technology. I've spent my whole life watching ESL speakers struggle to work with devices, particularly vocally-triggered ones, which seems highly unfair as companies lean into these new technologies.

I believe that if a machine can be taught proper English, it can be taught improperly as well. I am currently training Google Assistant to learn my mom's phonetic pronunciations, grammar arrangement, and other tics when speaking. Hopefully this can develop to help non-native speakers in general, as well as inspire other languages to also adapt their Alexas and Siris to learn second language understanding as well.
