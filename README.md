# Raspberry Pi Project (Working Title)

## Who Am I
Hi! I am a fairly new engineering student investigating optics and electromagnetism at Boston University. Until my start at BU, I spent seven years studying linguistics and translation, so transitioning to STEM was a huge change for me. There have been a lot of things to catch up on, things I've had to put on hold learning due to time and financial constraints, and other mental struggles that come with this new career path. Still, I love what I'm doing, and don't regret a day of this new experience.

One of the things that has been lacking from my program is the opportunity to learn programming. Spending all of your time catching up doing math and physics problems takes away time from building code that goes into data collection, experimentation, and other modern approaches to science. After spending last semester painfully pushing through two coding courses, I realized I needed a calmer environment where I could learn in my own way: picking up computer languages such that it serves my interests and career goals. My professor offered me the chance to do so over winter break through creating my own programming project, which brings me to this job now.

## The Project
Originally, I intended to build a simple rotating polarizer using a a Raspberry Pi, but given the time it takes for servo motors to ship over, I'm going to use what I have on hand.

<p align="center">The current supplies I have are:</p>

- Raspberry Pi (2, I think, not entirely sure)
- Google Nest Mini (Second Gen)
- My ASUS Laptop
- A bunch of computer mice
- My partner's keyboard (hoping to borrow one at school rather than buying an extra one that I probably won't need that often)
- Lots of Nintendo equipment (Switch, 3DS, etc.)
- Xbox 360
- Wireless headphones
- My Android phone
- Breadboards, resistors, LEDs, etc. for circuitry

I'm sure within this assortment of tools there is something cool I can make that will help me learn.

## Project Goal
My personal goal is to just become more confortable with programming. I feel like my classes threw me into simply providing answers without actually sitting down and understanding the thoughts behind the code. By the end of this, I just want to be able to actually explain what my project does from the inside out.
          
The goal of this actualy project is TBD, since I don't know what I'm making yet.
